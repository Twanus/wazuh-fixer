To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords.

,all,"This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps ""passphrase"" is a better term than ""password."" In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as ""I want to drink a $5 milkshake"" is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements. The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s). Note: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password length.

When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers.

,all,"LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations: - Join a domain - Authenticate between Active Directory forests - Authenticate to down-level domains - Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP - Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.

The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.","[{""value"":""2.3.11.7"",""key"":""cis""},{""value"":""9.2"",""key"":""cis_csc_v7""},{""value"":""3.10"",""key"":""cis_csc_v8""},{""value"":""AC.L2-3.1.13,AC.L2-3.1.17,IA.L2-3.5.10,SC.L2-3.13.11,SC.L2-3.13.15,SC.L2-3.13.8"",""key"":""cmmc_v2.0""},{""value"":""164.312(a)(2)(iv),164.312(e)(1),164.312(e)(2)(i),164.312(e)(2)(ii)"",""key"":""hipaa""},{""value"":""A.13.1.3"",""key"":""iso_27001-2013""},{""value"":""AC-17(2),SC-8,SC-8(1)"",""key"":""nist_sp_800-53""},{""value"":""2.1.1,4.1,4.1.1,8.2.1"",""key"":""pci_dss_v3.2.1""},{""value"":""2.2.7,4.1.1,4.2.1,4.2.1.2,4.2.2,8.3.2"",""key"":""pci_dss_v4.0""}]","[{""rule"":""r:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa"",""type"":""registry""},{""rule"":""r:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa -> LmCompatibilityLevel"",""type"":""registry""},{""rule"":""r:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa -> LmCompatibilityLevel -> 5"",""type"":""registry""}]"

Events for this subcategory include: - 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. - 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. - 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. - 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. - 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. - 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully. - 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. - 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer.
