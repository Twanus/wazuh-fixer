# defaults file for win_network_access_null_session_shares
# CIS Benchmark 2.3.10.11 (check 26048) requires 'Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously' to be set to 'None' (blank/empty)
# This setting requires the NullSessionShares registry value to be removed (not set)
# No default variables needed - the value should simply not exist
