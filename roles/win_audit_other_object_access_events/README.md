# win_audit_other_object_access_events

This role remediates CIS Benchmark 17.6.3 (check 26153): Ensure 'Audit Other Object Access Events' is set to 'Success and Failure'.

## Description

This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by the management of task scheduler jobs or COM+ objects. For scheduler jobs, the following are audited:
- Job created
- Job deleted
- Job enabled
- Job disabled
- Job updated

For COM+ objects, the following are audited:
- Catalog object added
- Catalog object updated
- Catalog object deleted

The unexpected creation of scheduled tasks and COM+ objects could potentially be an indication of malicious activity. Since these types of actions are generally low volume, it may be useful to capture them in the audit logs for use during an investigation.

The recommended state for this setting is: **Success and Failure**.

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.9 or higher
- Windows target host
- WinRM connectivity
- Appropriate permissions to modify audit policy settings (typically requires Administrator privileges)
- The `auditpol.exe` command must be available (included in Windows by default)

## Role Variables

This role does not require any variables to be set. The audit policy is configured to "Success and Failure" by default.

## Dependencies

None.

## Example Playbook

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Audit Other Object Access Events
  hosts: windows
  gather_facts: true
  become: false
  roles:
    - role: twanus.wazuh_fixer.win_audit_other_object_access_events
```

Or using the development path:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Audit Other Object Access Events
  hosts: windows
  gather_facts: true
  become: false
  roles:
    - role: ../roles/win_audit_other_object_access_events  # noqa role-name[path]
```

## Compliance

This role addresses the following compliance requirements:

- **CIS Benchmark**: 17.6.3 (check 26153)
- **CIS CSC v7**: 6.3
- **CIS CSC v8**: 8.5
- **CMMC v2.0**: AU.L2-3.3.1
- **ISO 27001:2013**: A.12.4.1
- **NIST SP 800-53**: AU-3(1), AU-7
- **PCI DSS v3.2.1**: 10.1, 10.2.2, 10.2.4, 10.2.5, 10.3
- **PCI DSS v4.0**: 10.2, 10.2.1, 10.2.1.2, 10.2.1.5, 9.4.5
- **SOC 2**: CC5.2, CC7.2

## Command Details

This role uses the `auditpol.exe` command to configure the audit policy:

- **Check Command**: `auditpol.exe /get /subcategory:"Other Object Access Events"`
- **Set Command**: `auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:"Other Object Access Events" /success:enable /failure:enable`

The check command output typically looks like:
```
System audit policy

Category/Subcategory                      Setting
Other Object Access Events                Success and Failure
```

## Group Policy Configuration

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the following UI path to Success and Failure:
- **Path**: `Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\Audit Policies\Object Access\Audit Other Object Access Events`

## Verification

You can verify the setting using PowerShell:

```powershell
auditpol.exe /get /subcategory:"Other Object Access Events"
```

The output should show "Success and Failure" for the Other Object Access Events subcategory.

Alternatively, you can verify using Group Policy:

1. Open `gpedit.msc` (Local Group Policy Editor)
2. Navigate to `Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\Audit Policies\Object Access`
3. Check that "Audit Other Object Access Events" is set to "Success and Failure"

## Idempotency

This role is idempotent. If the audit policy is already set to "Success and Failure", no changes will be made.

## Notes

- This setting enables auditing for both successful and failed object access events related to task scheduler jobs and COM+ objects.
- The events captured are useful for detecting potentially malicious activity involving scheduled tasks and COM+ objects.
- Since these events are generally low volume, they can be captured in audit logs without significant performance impact.
- This role requires Administrator privileges to modify audit policy settings.
- The `auditpol.exe` command is available by default on Windows systems.
